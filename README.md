# Exercism
Welcome to my repository of exercise solutions with [Exercise](https://exercism.org/profiles/vladdarkstalker)!

Here I lay out my solutions for various programming languages and simultaneously learn new concepts and approaches to coding.
My goal is to gain a deep understanding of each language.
Languages I study: Go, Python, Bash, C++, Java, Kotlin, SQLite.
